I am a postdoctoral researcher and the Coordinator for Resource-Aware Machine Learning at the [Lamarr Institute](https://lamarr-institute.org/). Before that, I was a [Ph.D. student](https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/buschjaeger.html) in the [artificial intelligence group](https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/index.html) at TU Dortmund University in Germany. There, I participated in the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876, [project A1](https://sfb876.tu-dortmund.de/SPP/sfb876-a1.html) in which I studied novel machine learning methods for embedded systems and small devices. I received my Ph.D. in 2022 with distinction (summa cum laude) titled "Ensemble learning with discrete classifiers on small devices." Apart from research, I play badminton, run, and watch too many movies. 

My formal CV is available in [German](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf) or [English](/assets/pdf/cv_eng.pdf).

<!-- Sebastian BuschjÃ¤ger is a PhD candidate at the [artificial intelligence group](https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/index.html) of the TU Dortmund University, Germany. His main research is about resource efficient Machine Learning algorithms and specialized hardware for Machine Learning. He focuses on ensemble methods and randomized algorithms combined with specialized hardware such as FPGAs. Sebastian began to study Computer Science in 2007 as part of the pupils program of TU Dortmund which enables highschool students to visit the university  and take part in its daily coursework. After finishing his Abitur in  2010 he enrolled as a full student at the TU Dortmund where he received  his B.Sc. in 2014 and Master in 2016 in computer science.  -->

#### research topics

- **Machine Learning** Ensemble learning, model application, submodular functions
- **Computer Architecture** Architecture-dependent optimizations and code generation, custom architectures/FPGAs, embedded devices
